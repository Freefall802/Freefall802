#### Hi, I’m Seth! <br>
I'm an Aerospace Engineer with a BSE in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Michigan. I enjoy finding ways to combine computer science and aerospace engineering. <br>
Currently, I'm learning ways to incorporate machine learning into aerospace-related projects, design control systems in aircraft, and implement additive manufacturing methods to create drone/RC plane builds.
